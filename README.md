# Brain structure and function

Overview 
- Lobes of the brain (Forebrain)
- Mindbrain/Hindbrain
- Protection and blood supply structure and function of a neuron
- synnaptic transmission 
- neurotransmitters  

The brain
- Most complex organ of the body
- Only weighs 1,300 grams
- Contains billions of neural networks that interact to create human hehaviour

Sulci - Fissures 

Gyri - Bumps / Fold


Evolve - we will hav emore sulci / gyri smaller heads

## Forebrain
- Cerebrum and cerebaral cortex
- Left and right hemispheres
- Left hemisphere for most people is the dominant hemisphere- responsiible for production of language, mathematical ability, problem solving, logic 
- Right hemisphere thought to be responsivible for creativity and spatial ability 

## Frontal Lobe 
- Located at the front of both cerebral emispheres
- Primary motor cortex
- Pre motor cortex
- Brocas Area- Motor production of speech
- Complex Functioning- personality judgement insight reasoning problem solving, abstracting thinking and working memory

## Parietal lobe
- Located behind the frontal lobe
- Somatosensory cortex
- Spatial orientation, preception and comprehension of language function recognising object by touch
- Links visual and somatosensory information together 
- Neglect

## Temporal Lobes
- Located at each sid eof the brain
- Involved in receiving and processsing auditory information, higher order visual information, complex aspects of memory and language
- Wenickes Area Compression of speech

## Occipital lobes
- Rearmost portation of the brain
- Visual processing area
- Corpus Callosum Fibre bundle in the brain that connects the two hemispheres together 


## Diencephalon
- Thalamus: filters sensory information, controls, mood states and body movement associated with emotive states
- Hypothalamus: `Central control` for pituitary gland. Regulates autonomic, emotional, endocrine, and somatic function. Has a direct involvement in stress and mood states

## Hindbrain
- Cerebellum: regulates equilibrium muscle tone, postural control, fine movement and coordination of voluntary muscle movement.
- Pons: Relay station between cerebrum and cerebellum


Medulla oblongata - Consious control of skeletal muscles balance cooordination regulating soudn impulsing in the inner ear regulation fo automatic responses such as heart rates swallowing vmoting coughing and sneezing

**Basal ganglia** control fo muscle tone, activity, postture, large, muscole movements and inhibit unwanted musicle movements

**Substatia Nigra** - Produces dopamine is connected to the basal ganglia - EPSE's

## The llibic system
- Amygdala: Meidates and controls major affective mood states such a friendship, love affection, fear, rage and aggression.
- Hippocampus - Memory, particularly the ability to turn short turn memory into long term memory. Alzeimer's disease.

## Protection and blood suplpy
- Meaninges - durat mater and pia mater 
- CSF - 2 main functions; shock absorption and mediation of blood vessels and brain tissue in exchange of nutrients
- Circle of willies - Carotid arteries and baliser arteries

## Synaptic transmission 
- Calcium ion channels
- Synapse 
- Lock and key effect
- Reuptake

### Synaptic transmitter

## Nuerotransmitters

- **Acetylchonline (ACh)** Release through the brain via cholinergic pathways. Plays role in: 
  - Cognition (memory)
  - Sleep/wake cycle
  - Parasympathetiic
  - Regulation of heart rate, digestion producction of saliva, bladder function
  - smooth muscle contraction

## Monoamines 
- **Norepinepherine (NE)** Found mainly in 3 areas of the brain; the locus coeruleous, the pons and reticular formation Main Role:  
  - Attention, alertness, arousal
  - sleep/wake cycle
  - regulating mood/anxiety

## Dopamine (DA)
Almost a million nerve cells in the brain contain dopamine. Role in;
  - Complex movement
  - Cognition
  - motor control
  - emotional responses such as euphoria or pleasure
Bewer antipsychotic medication focus on dopaminergic pathways in the brain. Lessening EPSE's

# Serotonin (5HT)
Believed to be one of the great influences on behaviour. COmplex neurotrasmitter. Suprissingly only 2% of the serotonin is found in CNS. Roles include
  - Vasoconstriction, gastrointestinal regulation.
  - Low Serotonin associated with agression, suicide, implusive eating, anxiety and low mood
  - Regulates general activity of the CNS, particularly sleep.
  - Delusions, hallucinations and some negative symptoms of schizophrenia

# Amino Acids
- **Glutamate** 
  - Found in all cells
  - controls opening of ion channels
  - blocking glutamate produces psychotic sympotoms
  - Over exposure to glutamate causes cell death
- **GABA (Gamma-aminobutyric acid)**
  - Only found in CNS
  - Inhibitory neurotransmitter
  - controls excitatory neurotransmitters
  - Implicated in anxierty disorders

# Nature vs Nurture

Nature
- Rooots of approach
  Biology / Evolution
- Cases "Genetic determinism" neurochemical imbalances 


# Freud Discovers the unconscious 
- Studies in hysteria, published by Freud and Breuer 
  - Case of Anna O. and use of hypnosis in treating hysteria
- **Free association**: Description of hidden memories by patients that seemed related to the causes and cure of hysterical symptoms 

- Early traumatic sexual experiences were responsible for hysterical symptoms expressed by adult patients
- Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (Formed by Freud and his followers)
  
# Topographic model
- Personality is divided into different levels of awareness
  - **Conscious**: Thoughts a person is currenly aware of
  - **Preconscious**: Retrievable information
  - **Unconscious**: Thoughts that cannot be easily brought into awareness (except under extreme situations)
